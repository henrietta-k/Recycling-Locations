# Recycling-Locations
Hong Kong has a notoriously low recycling rate, however, in recent times, more and more recycling stations are popping up to make recycling more accessible and convenient for citizens. Many communities have a recycling station near them, but many people don't actually know this. This program asks the user to input the district that they live in, then uses BFS to output all recycling stations in Hong Kong ranked from closest to farthest from where the user lives (based on MTR station distances). That way, people can easily choose which recycling stations are nearest to their houses to go to. It also tells the user which stations are on the same MTR line to make it even more convenient and lets the user choose whether they want to see the full address or not.
